# Fall Detector

The project is a web application designed to detect falls from uploaded images using a pre-trained deep-learning model. It is built with Streamlit for the web interface and TensorFlow for the machine-learning model

## Objectives
- To create an easy-to-use web application that can detect falls from images.

## Key Features:
- User Interface: Developed using Streamlit, it provides a simple and interactive interface for users.
- Image Upload: Allows users to upload images in .jpg or .png format.
- Model Prediction: Utilizes a TensorFlow model to predict whether the uploaded image shows a normal situation or a fall.
- Result Display: Shows the uploaded image and the prediction result on the same page.

## Developer
- James Ba√±ez
